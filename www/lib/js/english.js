They wrote a dense story that reached its end with dignity in 1994, after fifteen intense years of activity. The fact that all of them are in a perfect musical shape made them take the brave decision of coming back to the stages and “recycling” and updating a musical idea that will always be valid, showing in their live work “ZUZEN!” their powerful musical personality.

This year they will go back to the stage of this festival sixth edition to present their second album which they have already named as  “Mapas”. Once more they will demonstrate that we are in front of a band that has grown up on the stages where the audience’s complicity becomes one of their great trump cards.';

In 2007 it arrived “Yours Truly, Angry Mob”, preceded by the advance single and great hit “Rudy” and it slipped in the first place of the British sales lists.

  lang_en['artista922texto']='Seasick Steve (Steven Gene Wold) is a Californian bluesman born in 1941. When he was only eight years old he met the blues musician KC Douglas, who taught him how to play the guitar and a way to earn some money playing on the streets. In the 60’s he started to tour with some bluesmen, to work as a studio musician and as the producer of many independent artists. In 2004 his first album “Cheap” arrived with the two Norwegian musicians but it was with his second work, his first one as a soloist called “Dog House Music” (2006), which succeeded in the UK. Then, the tours and festivals came along with the international recognition and other three albums. His last album is the recently released “You Can’t Teach An Old Dog New Trick".';   
  lang_en['artista923texto']='Carlos Tarque (voice) and Ricardo Ruipérez (guitars) keep in good shape this veteran band from Murcia, Spain, formed in 1993 under the influence Southern rock first called El Clan del Murciélago. Along the lines of bands like Black Crowes and somehow heirs of the southern rock from the 70s, M-Clan mixes  blues, soul and hard with their own cokctail shaker reaching effervescence in concert. In their last album “Para no ver el final”,  Carlos Tarque and Ricardo Ruipérez have taken the band to a more energetic sound in some themes with metal arrangements, deep guitars and less poetic but sharper lyrics both in joy as in desperation.';   
  lang_en['artista924texto']='This Hawaiian passed from being a surf film director and very keen in this sport to become a renowned singer and composer when he released his first album, “Brushfire Fairytales”, in 2001. Ben Harper did not doubt in signing for him in his discographic label and, since then, his success has not stopped growing. Johnson has passed from taking waves with his friends to tour with them filling up concert halls and performing in the best festivals of the world. That is how he arrives now to Bilbao within the tour of his fifth studio album entitled “To The Sea” and released in 2010. This album debuted as top list in the USA and sold more than 240,000 copies in only one week.';
